# 5.4 Writing and using top-level methods

Sometimes instead of writing your own modules or classes you just want a quick
script. So instead of wrapping all your methods in a class, you can use the 
top-level default object, `main`.

`main` is an instance of the `Object` class. It gets instantiated automatically
when you use methods that you've defined outside of a class.

## Defining a top-level method

An example:

```ruby
def talk
    puts "Hello!"
end
```

The `talk` method isn't defined inside a class or module. This is called "defining at the top level." The previous code is the equivalent to this:

```ruby
class Object
    private
    def talk
        puts "Hello!"
    end
end
```

## Predefined (built-in) top-level methods

We just used one! `puts`

```ruby
puts "Hello!"
```
