# 5.3 Deploying method-access rules

Object-oriented programming revolves around objects, messages, and objects
sending or receiving messages. Here's a poor example:

```ruby
car = Car.last
car.fix_engine if car.engine.status eql? "broken"
car.rotate_tires if car.tires.status eql? "need_rotation"
=> "Tires rotated!"
car.align_wheels if car.tires.status eql? "good" && car.tires.last_rotated > 6.months.ago
=> "Wheels aligned!"
```

Too much chatter! [SOLID](http://williamdurand.fr/2013/07/30/from-stupid-to-solid-code/) objects share their information on a need-to-know basis only. For example, how about this?

```ruby
car = Car.last
car.repair! if car.status eql? "broken"
=> "Engine doesn't need fixing."
=> "Tires rotated!"
=> "Wheels aligned!"
```

Much better! But we can tighten up the `Car` class even more ...

```ruby
car = Car.last
car.status
=> "Sorry, that's a private method now."
car.repair!
=> "Car repaired!"

car = Car.new
car.repair!
=> "Nothing to repair."
```

As you can see, designing classes with tight lips makes for a better user 
experience. How can we do this?

## Private methods

Private methods (and attributes) keep our classes quiet. A good rule of thumb:
Keep it private until you *must* make it public (or protected).

Example of a public method calling a private method:

```ruby
class Car
    attr_reader :make, :model, :year

    def initialize(make, model, year)
        @make = make
        @model = model
        @year = year
    end

    def repair!
        self.fix_engine
        self.rotate_tires
        self.align_wheels
    end

    private

    def fix_engine
        ...
    end

    ...
end
```

The author offers an excellent cake-baking metaphor here to explain this principle.


### Private setter (=) methods

Sometimes you may want to allow the user to set the value of an attribute after
having initialized an instance of a class. Here you may use what's known as a
"setter" method.

```ruby
class Odometer
    attr_reader :miles
    ...

    def miles=(value)
        puts "tsk tsk ಠ_ಠ"
        @miles = value
    end

    ...
end
```

So what's a _private_ setter method? The author provides an example:

```ruby
class Dog
    attr_reader :name, :age, :dog_years
    ...

    def age=(years)
        @age = years
        self.dog_years = years * 7
    end

    def to_s
        "#{self.name} is #{self.dog_years} in dog years."
    end

    private

    def dog_years=(years)
        @dog_years = years
    end
end
```

The `Dog` class lets us do this:

```ruby
rover = Dog.new("Rover")
rover.age = 10
rover.to_s
=> "Rover is 70 in dog years."
```

Note if we hadn't used `self` in the `age=` method, then we would observe the 
following:

```ruby
rover = Dog.new("Rover")
rover.age = 10
=> NoMethodError: private method 'dog_years=' called for #<Dog0x000012341a9 @age=10>

Use these with caution. As you can imagine, allowing for the willy-nilly 
overriding of object information can lead to trouble.

## Protected methods

Protected methods are "like a slightly kinder, gentler private method." They're
useful when you want one instance of a certain class to do something with 
another instance of the same class.

I like to think of protected methods as a way to say, "All instances (objects) 
of this class are in a special clique. The only way to know certain 
information about these objects is to become a member (instance) of this
class."

See `Listing 5.9` for a clear use case of protected methods.
